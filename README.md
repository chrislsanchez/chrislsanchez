ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian @chrislsanchez, electronics engineer passionate about technology and DIY enthusiast.

ðŸ‘€ I like embedded systems and electronics design in general but mostly I like implementing new technologies and making things work. Iâ€™ve work with a bunch of interdisciplinary teams in projects from building robots for competitions, toys for impaired children until communications systems for launchers.

ðŸŒ± These repositories are mostly leaved here for me and for anyone that could find some use on them. As much as other developers, I recycle and improve my code constantly and I like to have it handy. I like programming in C because I like to be close to silicon (but not too close), however, Iâ€™m always learning and testing new technologies.
